## Date created
The project and README were created on 25/02/2019

## Description
This project analyses bike sharing data for three cities in the United States; Chicago, New York and Washington using the Python programming language. The program imports data from comma separated (CSV) files and generates descriptive statistics.

## Files used
_bikeshare_2.py_ <br>
_README.md_ <br>
_chicago.csv_ <br>
_new_york_city.csv_ <br>
_washington.csv_ <br>
_Note: The csv datafiles listed contain bikeshare data for the city in filename. At least one of these datafiles are required to run the program but were not uploaded to Github due to space considerations._
